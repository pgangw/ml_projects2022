# **Final Project: Predicting visitor purchases & discovering the UX features relevant to purchases on the Google Merchandise website using Machine Learning**

## About the project

It is known that data science can be used to discover user behavior and needs. Investigating Google Analytics (GA) data such as pageviews, bounces, device category, etc. can be used to enhance the UX of a website. This project explores how UX designers and researchers today can leverage from the capabilities of ML to enhance experiences for users, by studying user behavior on the Google Merchandise website. 

This project is created as part of a classroom assignment at Pratt Institute, NYC in December 2022.

## Research questions

The project will answer the following research questions:
1. Will a new visitor to the Google Merchandise website make a revenue-generating transaction in the ecommerce store? 
2. Which features of the website/user experience are relevant in contributing to making purchases?

## Data source

Visitor-wise data for 6 months (1 August 2016 through 31 January 2017) is collected from Google Merchandiseâ€™s GA data using BigQuery on the Google Console. Columns in the dataset are shortlisted on the basis of their hopthesized connection with the UX of a website.

## Overview of the models used

The solution has the following steps:

1. Exploratory data analysis 

2. Linear learner

3. Non-linear model

4. Adding preprocessing steps 

5. Used the best model from step 4 to create a fucntion called `credit_approval` that takes a single row of data and predict if a credit card will be granted or not.
