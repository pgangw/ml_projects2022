# Assignment - Supervised Learning

## Description

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. Banks use machine learning to automate this process.

In this project, I built a credit card approval predictor using supervised machine learning techniques discussed during the class.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Solution

The solution has the following steps:

1. Exploratory data analysis 

2. Linear learner

3. Non-linear model

4. Adding preprocessing steps 

5. Used the best model from step 4 to create a fucntion called `credit_approval` that takes a single row of data and predict if a credit card will be granted or not.
